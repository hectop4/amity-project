# Space Exploration Rover for Agricultural Management and Data Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the amity-project repository presenting the prototype for a Rover developed at Universidad Pedagogica y Tecnologica de Colombia (UPTC) by the electronic engineering team. The purpose of this project is to create a Rover capable of exploring unknown environments.

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32**: The ESP32 microcontroller is the core of the Rover's hardware, providing processing power and connectivity capabilities.
- **Python**: Python programming language is utilized for developing the software components of the Rover, enabling easy integration and flexibility.
- **Linux**: The Rover's operating system is based on Linux, providing a stable and customizable platform for running the software stack.

## Installation

To install the required Python libraries for this project, simply use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, ensuring that the project can be run smoothly on your system.

**Hardware_Code** Contains the code in the ESP32 to open with PlatformIO
**Interface** Contains the Human-Machine Interface
