        Hello, if you haven't seen me before allow to introduce myself. My name
        is Hector, right now I am studying the carreer of Eletronic Engineering
        in Colombia.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">
        I am a person who likes to learn new things, I am always looking for new
        challenges and I am always looking for new ways to improve myself. This
        has lead me to create my social media and my blog by the name of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SeamosIngeniosos"
          ><span class="text-primary">Seamos Ingeniosos</span></a
        >, where I share my knowledge and my experiences. Not only in
        Engineering, but in many other areas as productivity, self-development,
        and more.
